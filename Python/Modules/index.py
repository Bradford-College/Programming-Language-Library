    Modules in Python
    Keyword: import

    In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules can be used to organize code into manageable sections and to reuse code across multiple programs.

    There are three types of modules:
    1. User-defined modules: Custom modules created by the user.
    2. Built-in modules: Standard modules that come with Python.
    3. External modules: Third-party modules that can be installed via pip.
