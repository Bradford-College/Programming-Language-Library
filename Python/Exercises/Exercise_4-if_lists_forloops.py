# Exercise 4: If-Statements, Lists, and For Loops in Python

# Step 1: Define a list of numbers
# Create a list named 'numbers' that contains the following items: [12, 45, 23, 67, 34, 89, 10]

# numbers = ...

# Step 2: Iterate over the list using a for loop
# Use a for loop to iterate over each number in the 'numbers' list

# for number in numbers:
#     # Step 3: Use if-statements to check if the number is even or odd
#     # If the number is even, print "X is even" (replace X with the number)
#     # If the number is odd, print "X is odd" (replace X with the number)

#     if ...:  # Check if the number is even
#         print(f"{number} is even")
#     else:  # The number is odd
#         print(f"{number} is odd")
